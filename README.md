  <h1>WeMod Patcher</h1>
</div>

<h4>WeMod patcher allows you to get some WeMod Pro features absolutely free. This script patches WeMod, thereby removing the daily usage limit (2h), etc.</h4>

## 👾 No malware? Is it safe for me?

Yes, this is safe. This script is open-source, and you can check the code yourself. I have no intention of harming you or your computer. The script does absolutely nothing with your computer and does not require Internet access. It only affects WeMod files.

## 💻 Does this script only work with older versions of WeMod like other unlockers?

With this patch you will be able to use the latest version together with Pro.

## 💫  What features will be available?

✅ Unlimited usage time <br/>
✅ No ads <br/>
✅ AI Game guides <br/>
✅ Saving mods <br/>
❌ Connect phone <br/>
❌ Hotkeys (hotkey functionality breaks after patch for unknown reason)

## 👀 How to use?

1. Download Loader.rar version
2. Run and click the patch

## ❓ Q&A

- I applied the patch but when I inject I get stuck on 'Loading mods...'.
  - Just close WeMod and try again
- During the game, some hacks are enabled without my input
  - This is a bug after the patch, you have to turn off hotkeys in WeMod settings
- Why is the patch executable file size so large? It seems to me that you want to harm my system.
  - The thing is that the application is written in Electron, so it also puts chromium, nodejs and some libraries in the exe. Maybe Electron is a temporary solution and in the future I will consider another option
